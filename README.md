# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction

Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis of CVD can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient data. We will use a publicly available dataset, preprocess the data, train various machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The best-performing model will be selected for deployment.

2. Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases encompass a range of heart and blood vessel disorders. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Machine learning offers promising methods to predict CVD by analyzing complex patterns in patient data.

3. Existing System
Traditional methods for CVD prediction include statistical analysis and rule-based systems. These methods often rely on a limited number of features and may not capture the complex relationships between risk factors. Recent advancements in machine learning provide more accurate and robust predictions by leveraging large datasets and sophisticated algorithms.

4. Proposed System
The proposed system utilizes machine learning techniques to predict cardiovascular disease. We will explore various algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. The system will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
